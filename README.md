# Password Strength Analyzer 🔐  

A simple Python tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on security best practices. It checks for **length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and common patterns**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Checks password strength (**Weak, Moderate, Strong**)  
✅ Detects common security vulnerabilities  
✅ Provides **suggestions to improve password security**  
✅ Simple **GUI using Tkinter**  
✅ Uses **Regex (Regular Expressions)** for pattern matching  
✅ Implements **SHA-256 hashing** for password security  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (Built-in with Python)  

## 📥 Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-analyzer.git
   cd password-analyzer
python password_analyzer.py
📌 How It Works
1️. User enters a password in the input field.
2. The tool analyzes the password using security rules:

## 📌 How It Works  
- **User enters a password** in the input field.  
- The tool **analyzes the password** based on the following security rules:  
- At least **8 characters** long  
- Contains **uppercase & lowercase letters**  
- Includes **numbers & special characters**  
- Avoids **common passwords** (e.g., `"123456"`, `"password"`)  
- 📊 **Displays password strength** as **Weak, Moderate, or Strong**.  
- 💡 If the password is weak, it **suggests ways to improve security**.  

🛡️ Security Measures
- Uses SHA-256 hashing for storing passwords securely.
- Prevents common password vulnerabilities.
